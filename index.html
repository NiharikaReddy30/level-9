    Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.
    Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.
    It is when people move to a musical rhythm, like a drum beat.
    They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be an informal play, a part of a ritual, or a part of a professional performance. 
    There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances.
